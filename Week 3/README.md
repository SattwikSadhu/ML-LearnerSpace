NOTES regarding ImagePreprocessing-OpenCV.ipynb:
1. Although it was asked not to insert any extra cells, I had to add one to unzip the contents of the images.zip file in Colab.
2. Under the Comparison section in the notebook, the colors of the masked region in Masked_Mentee and Masked are not matching because the Masked_Mentee was not converted to RGB from BGR before plotting. However, as instructed, I didn't change the contents of that cell.
